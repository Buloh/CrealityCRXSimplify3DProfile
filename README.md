# Simplify 3D Profile for the Creality CR-X

We've (https://www.diyelectronics.co.za/store/) done a lot of playing with the new CR-X and this is the profile we are using, which is working better than any others I've found, and better than the stuff that comes with the printer.

The tool change retraction works the same way that Creality tells you to do it. Before your first print, load both filaments into the bowden tube until just above the entrance to hotend assembly. After the print they'll end up there again so you don't need to do anything.
